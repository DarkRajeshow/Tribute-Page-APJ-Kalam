            <h3 class="subheading">- Early Life and Education</h3>
            <p class="biographyPara">Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was an Indian aeronautical scientist who served as the country’s
                11th president from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in the city of Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, where
                he went on to study physics and aerospace engineering.</p>
            <p class="biographyPara">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, on
                Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency, now in Tamil Nadu. Kalam was the youngest of five
                siblings.</p>
            <p class="biographyPara">His ancestors had been affluent traders and landlords, owning enormous property
                holdings. Kalam’s family was impoverished in his early youth. Apart from the ancestral home, the family
                fortune and assets were lost with the building of the Pamban Bridge. The family came to be known as
                “Mara Kalam Iyakkivar” (later on reduced to “Marakier”), meaning wooden boat steerers, as the main
                family business was ferrying pilgrims. Kalam sold newspapers to support his family financially.</p>
            <p class="biographyPara">APJ Abdul Kalam, the missile man of India and the former president, continues to be
                an inspiration to many people of all ages and from all backgrounds. His commitment to science and
                technology and his service to the country earned him the title “Missile Man of the Country.” The
                majority of individuals consider him to be their true inspiration.</p>

                        <li>Under his command, he had a team of India’s best soldiers.</li>
                        <li>He simultaneously served as Prime Minister’s Chief Scientific Adviser from July 1992 to
                            December
                            1999, and also the Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation
                            (DRDO).
                        </li>
                        <li>In 1998, Kalam and Dr Soma Raju collaborated to design a low-cost coronary stent. The
                            stent
                            was
                            dubbed the “Kalam-Raju Stent.” For rural health care, the “Kalam-Raju Tablet” was
                            created in
                            2012.</li>
                        <li>The Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998 proved India’s nuclear capabilities. Without Dr
                            Kalam’s
                            assistance, this project would not have been possible. Such weapons, he explained to the
                            international community, would serve solely as “weapons of peace” to discourage other
                            countries
                            from the annexation of Indian territory.</li>
                        <li>As the leader of India’s missile programme in the 1980s, political parties came together
                            in
                            2002
                            to elect APJ Abdul Kalam as the country’s eleventh president.</li>
